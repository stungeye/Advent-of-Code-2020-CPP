# Advent-of-Code-2020-CPP

Working through some of the 2020 Advent of Code puzzles using C++.

* Day 1 - ExpenseReport
* Day 2 - PasswordPolicy
* Day 3 - TobogganTrajectory

I'm using Visual Studio 2019 for my IDE with CMake for the build system. 

I've got a small number of unit test for each solution (really just testing final answers, but good enough to allow me to refactor) built using Catch2.
